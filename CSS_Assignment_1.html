    <p class="t1">Mom, you're a wonderful mother,<br>
       So gentle, yet so strong.<br>
       The many ways you show you care <br>
       Always make me feel I belong.<br><br>

       You're patient when I'm foolish;<br>
       You give guidance when I ask;<br>
       It seems you can do most anything;<br>
       You're the master of every task.<br><br>

       You're a dependable source of comfort;<br>
       You're my cushion when I fall.<br>
       You help in times of trouble;<br>
       You support me whenever I call.<br><br>

       I love you more than you know;<br>
       You have my total respect.<br>
       If I had my choice of mothers,<br>
       You'd be the one I'd select!<br><br>
